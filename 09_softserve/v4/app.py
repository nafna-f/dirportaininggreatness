# Changes Detected:
# There is now a check to see if the file is running on the main module.
# Comments are also now in an informative state.
# Debug mode will only turn on if this is run on the main module.
# This is probably so that only the person writing and testing the code (i.e the only person who should be on the main module) can test their work.
# Other people (viewers; people who are not on the main module) will not see debug info.
